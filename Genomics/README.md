The GenomicsDataAnalysis reporsitory contains 2 projects for the course Genomics Data Analysis and Visualization:
- Genomics and Metagenomics (directory: genomics)
- Transcriptomics and SingleCellOmics (directory: transcriptomics_singlecellomics)

# Genomics and Metagenomics Project Overview
The final report (report.pdf) includes the code used to solve each question and the relevant explanations. Other files included are the phylogenetic trees created and the visualization of a variant of interest.
The sections of the project, including the tools used for each one, were:
**1. Metagenomics**: bash scripting, use of software from command line (motus).
**2. Genomics Data Exploratory**: bash scripting .
**3. Read Mapping**: bash scripting, use of software from command line (bowtie2, samtools).
**4. Variant Calling Analysis and Visualization**: bash scripting, use of software from command line (bcftools, samtools, IGV - Integrative Genomics Viewer).
**5. Differential Expression Analysis**: bash scripting, use of software from command line (htseq-count), R scripting (Bioconductor - DESeq). 
**6. Functional Prediction**: bash scripting, online resources (NCBI, BLAST, STRING-DB...).
**7. Phylogenetic Analysis**: bash scripting, software from command line (blast, clustalo, iqtree) and Python (ete3 package).
